# jahanavi-sinha-MarbleSolitaire
A graphical user interface (GUI) for a simple Marble Solitaire game. It is part 1 as a limitation is: when the user clicks on a cell, there is no visual feedback. I am currently working on another part of this game as an assignment for my Object Oriented Design course at Northeastern University.
